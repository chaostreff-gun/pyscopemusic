# pyscopemusic

We decided to fiddle around with (dis)playing sound on an oscilloscope.

In this repo you can find scripts we wrote during the process.

Useful links:
- http://oscilloscopemusic.com/ (there you can find some videos which you can directly play on your oscilloscope)
- http://www.swharden.com/wp/2011-07-08-create-mono-and-stereo-wave-files-with-python/ (we took that as an entry point to generating wave files ourselves)
